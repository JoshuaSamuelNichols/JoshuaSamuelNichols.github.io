# Introduction to Initiatives of Change

Frank Buchman, an American Lutheran pastor, founded an organization in the early 20th century called Moral Re-Armament (MRA), later evolving into Initiatives of Change (IofC). His mission focused on promoting personal and social transformation through the practice of integrity, honesty, and moral leadership. Buchman believed that individual moral change could lead to global peace and reconciliation, and his movement gained traction internationally as it worked toward bridging cultural and political divides.

Caux Initiatives of Change is a Switzerland-based non-profit organization dedicated to peacebuilding, trust-building, and ethical leadership. Established in 1946, it operates the Caux Conference and Training Centre, fostering dialogue and collaboration among global leaders, activists, and changemakers. IofC focuses on reconciliation, sustainable development, and social cohesion by empowering individuals and organizations to drive ethical, inclusive change. Through workshops, conferences, and training programs, Caux IofC promotes solutions that address conflict resolution, governance, and social responsibility worldwide.

# ðŸŽ¸ Nashville Music School's Student Database

This project contains an **SQL database** storing some of my students, their chosen **instruments**, and **years** of enrollment throughout the previous years. For data privacy purposes, this is a consolidated version of my database to showcase the minimal design, and not all of the confidential material.

``` sql
-- How I start my scripts
CREATE DATABASE NashvilleMusicSchoolDB;
USE NashvilleMusicSchoolDB;

-- Create the Students Table
CREATE TABLE Students (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    year INT
);

-- Create the Instruments Table 
CREATE TABLE Instruments (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT UNIQUE,  -- Ensures a student has only one instrument
    instrument VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES Students(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Sort my Students by year

# ðŸŽ¸ Nashville Music School's Student Database

This project contains an **SQL database** storing some of my students, their chosen **instruments**, and **years** of enrollment throughout the previous years. For data privacy purposes, this is a consolidated version of my database to showcase the minimal design, and not all of the confidential material.

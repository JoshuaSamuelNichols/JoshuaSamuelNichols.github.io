# About WSIS 
The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) Forum 2017 stands as the world’s largest annual gathering of the global ‘ICT for development’ community. This influential event serves as a premier global multi-stakeholder platform, dedicated to advancing the implementation of the WSIS Action Lines, which are critical to the pursuit of sustainable development across the world. The Forum is co-organized by a coalition of key international organizations, including the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), UNESCO, UNDP, and UNCTAD, working in close collaboration with various UN entities such as UNDESA, FAO, UNEP, WHO, UN Women, WIPO, WFP, ILO, WMO, ITC, UPU, UNODC, UNICEF, and the UN Regional Commissions.

The WSIS Forum plays a pivotal role in fostering the exchange of information and knowledge, facilitating the sharing of best practices, and identifying emerging trends that shape the future of Information and Knowledge Societies. It also serves as a platform for building strategic partnerships aimed at advancing the global development agenda through the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).

In the context of the United Nations’ broader goals, the WSIS Forum aligns its efforts with the outcomes of the UN General Assembly's Overall Review of the Implementation of WSIS Outcomes (Res. A/70/125) and the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (Res. A/70/1). As a result, the WSIS Forum is a dynamic and evolving platform, increasingly focused on ensuring that the WSIS Action Lines are in sync with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Forum has become an essential space for discussing how ICTs can be leveraged as a critical means of implementing the SDGs, while ensuring alignment with the global mechanisms for follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

By addressing the complex intersection of ICT, development, and sustainability, the WSIS Forum remains a cornerstone event, guiding global efforts to achieve a more inclusive and sustainable world through technology and innovation.

# Key Achievements

As a passionate advocate for promoting sustainability through technology, I have been deeply involved in initiatives aimed at helping developing countries harness innovative solutions to tackle global challenges. My role at the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) allowed me to contribute directly to the promotion of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in partnership with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Together, we worked to drive ICT solutions that empower communities around the world.

I contributed to several key areas of the WSIS initiative, including **database management**, **stocktaking**, **project management**, **social media strategy**, and **event coordination**. A significant part of my work involved **reviewing and investigating over 3,000 project submissions** for the WSIS Forum, ensuring each submission aligned with the 17 UN SDGs. Additionally, I **managed the database of reviewed projects**, optimizing the system to improve accessibility and streamline processes for the global community.

Beyond these technical tasks, I made important contributions to the **WSIS Reports**, including the *2017 WSIS Stocktaking Success Stories* and the *WSIS Forum 2017 Outcome Document*. These reports are key in tracking the progress of ICT-driven initiatives toward global development goals. I was also actively involved in organizing high-profile events, such as the **TEDx Geneva event**, where I played a central role in aligning discussions with themes of sustainable innovation. 

Another major initiative I co-managed was the **Hackathon - Hack For Health**, in collaboration with IEEE, WHO, and Be He@lthy Be Mobile. This event focused on developing health solutions for underserved regions, further demonstrating the potential of technology to address global health challenges.

In my social media strategy role, I **managed the WSIS Process social media channels**, where I created content that resonated with diverse global audiences and analyzed traffic to ensure engagement with SDG-focused discussions and ICT-related high-level sessions. One of my proudest achievements was **leading the first-ever WSIS Photo Contest Project**, which visually captured the transformative role of technology in driving global development.

Through these experiences, I have been able to combine my passion for sustainability, technology, and social impact to create lasting opportunities for developing countries, empowering them to leverage technology as a force for positive change.
